# Neural-Architecture-test

Just simple test library of neural architecture with dynamic weights on Python

`Connections.py` - The Connection class file.

`Neurons.py` - The main library class. For using example, examine this file.

Just add this files into your project and import `Neurons.py` in your executable.

For using GPU acceleration, you need to has installed `pyopencl` library and instead `Brain` class use `GPU_Brain`.
